Organizations & companies with product that has a UI
(User Interface) are required to test & validate the UI 
functionality.
These functional tests are carried out by dedicated, trained 
employees called “Manual Tester”. They perform manual 
software testing related to the UI, according to given and 
specific instructions.
These instructions are known as “User Scenarios”, and 
their purpose is to simulate a user who performs certain 
operations using software.
In case of a problem or finding, they will issue a report, 
describing the problem and transfer the report to the R&D 
team (which developed the UI) for further fixing and 
problem solving.

AutoDesktop is a software designed to save time and 
manpower, by replacing the manual testing with automated 
testing (a program that performs a series of actions, in a 
planned sequence) without human involvement.

AutoDesktop is a Python library that is integrated with 
software that is well-known to both software developers 
and users without any background.

The requirement from AutoDesktop is to enable creation 
of UI scenarios that automatically simulate the user's 
actions, and thus help to build scripts for UI scenarios for 
repetitive actions thereby achieving the goal of saving time 
and manpower.
